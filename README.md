## Getting started
The following steps will get you set up with the required packages (additional packages are required for the 3D textures setting, described below):

1.  Clone our repo: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/unadversarial.git`

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```
    conda create -n unadv python=3.7
    conda activate unadv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Generating unadversarial examples for CIFAR10
*Here we show a quick example how to generate unadversarial examples for CIFAR-10. Similar procedure can be used with ImageNet. The entry point of our code is [main.py](src/main.py) (see the file for a full description of arguments).*

1- Download a pretrained CIFAR10 models, e.g., 
  ```
  mkdir pretrained-models & 
  wget -O pretrained-models/cifar_resnet50.ckpt "https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhpp4yws7sgi6lj/cifar_nat.pt?raw=1"
  ```
2- Run the following script
  ```
  python -m src.main \
        --out-dir OUT_DIR \
        --exp-name demo \
        --dataset cifar \
        --data /tmp \
        --arch resnet50 \
        --model-path pretrained-models/cifar_resnet50.ckpt \
        --patch-size 10 \
        --patch-lr 0.001 \
        --training-mode booster \
        --epochs 30 \
        --adv-train 0
  ```
You can see the trained patches images in `outdir/demo/save/` as training evolves.

3- Now you can evaluate the pretrained model on a boosted CIFAR10-C dataset (trained patch overlaid on CIFAR-10, then corruptions are added). Simply run
  ```
  python -m src.evaluate_corruptions \
        --out-dir OUT_DIR \
        --exp-name demo \
        --model-path OUT_DIR/demo/checkpoint.pt.best \
        --args-from-store data,dataset,arch,patch_size
  ```    
This will evaluate the pretrained model on various corruptions and display the results in the terminal.

4- That's it! 

## Generating 3D unadversarial textures
The following steps were tested on these configurations:
- Ubuntu 16.04, 8 x NVIDIA 1080Ti/2080Ti, 2x10-core Intel CPUs (w/ HyperThreading, 40 virtual cores), CUDA 10.2
- Ubuntu 18.04, 2 x NVIDIA K80, 1x12-core Intel CPU, CUDA 10.2

1- Choose a dataset to use as background images; we used ImageNet in our paper, for which you will need to have ImageNet in PyTorch ``ImageFolder`` format somewhere on your machine. If you don't have that, you can just use solid colors as the backgrounds (though the results might not match the paper).

2- Install the requirements: you will need a machine with CUDA 10.2 installed (this process might work with other versions of CUDA but we only tested 10.2), as well as ``docker``, ``nvidia-docker``, and the requirements mentioned earlier in the README.

3- Go to the ``docker/`` folder and run ``docker build --tag TAG .``, changing ``TAG`` to your preferred name for your docker instance. This will build a docker instance with all the requirements installed!

4- Open ``launch.py`` and edit the ``IMAGENET_TRAIN`` and ``IMAGENET_VAL`` variables to point to the ImageNet dataset, if it's installed and you want to use it. Either way, change ``TAG`` on the last line of the file with whatever you named your docker instance in the last step.

5- Alter the parameters in ``src/configs/config.json`` according to your setup; the only things we would recommend altering are ``num_texcoord_renderers`` (this should not exceed the number of CPU cores you have available), ``exp_name`` (the name of the output folder, which will be created inside ``OUT_DIR`` from the previous step), and ``dataset`` (if you are using ImageNet, you can leave this be, otherwise change it to ``solids`` to use solid colors as the backgrounds).

6- From inside the docker folder, run ``python launch.py [--with-imagenet] --out-dir OUT_DIR --gpus GPUS `` from the same folder. The ``--with-imagenet`` argument should only be provided if you followed step four. The ``OUT_DIR`` argument should point to where you want the resulting models/output saved, and the ``GPUS`` argument should be a comma-separated list of GPU IDs that you would like to run the job on.

7- This process should open a new terminal (inside your docker instance). In this terminal, run ``GPU_MODE=0 bash run_imagenet.sh [bus|warplane|ship|truck|car] /src/configs/config.json /out``

8- Your 3D unadversarial texture should now be generating! Output, including example renderings, the texture itself, and the model checkpoint will be saved to ``$(OUT_DIR)/$(exp_name)``.  

An example texture that you would get for the `warplane` is

## Simulating 3D Unadversarial Objects in AirSim
Coming soon!

Environments, 3D models, along with python API for controlling these objects and running online object recognition inside [Microsoft's AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) high-fidelity simulator.
